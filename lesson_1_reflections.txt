How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It made easier to stop key part of the document, and made trivial to find the typo.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   It helps to have a control over what changes are made on a document.
	It's great for a team of developers

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual saves are good for keeping the importante changes, but its entierely possible to forget or lose small changes with a bad control of manua commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because git is focused in projects

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    After checking the log of changes I can know what files to compare with diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It gives one the confidence of having a rollback available

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    University project
